# Validation configuration
# Change mode to "strict" to see warnings become errors
validation:
  mode: "strict"  # Options: "lenient" (default) or "strict"
  # Note: Total estimation is 90% (not 100%), which will generate a warning
  # In lenient mode: passes with warning
  # In strict mode: fails with error

# Metadata for documentation

    - "Testing validation modes"
    - "Understanding warning vs error behavior"
  estimationGuidelines: |
    This template intentionally has estimation totaling 90% to demonstrate
    how lenient mode allows this with a warning, while strict mode fails.
